# Next Steps for Project Management CLI

This document outlines the planned future development for the Project Management CLI tool for AI assistants.

## Phase 1: AI Metadata Integration

### Objective

Enhance the tool with AI-specific metadata tracking to provide better context preservation between AI sessions.

### Tasks

1. **Schema Extension**

   - Add AI metadata tables to the database schema
   - Create models for storing assistant IDs, models, and reasoning paths
   - Implement versioning for metadata

2. **CLI Commands**

   - Add `pm metadata add` command for attaching metadata to tasks
   - Add `pm metadata show` command for retrieving metadata
   - Add `pm metadata search` command for finding tasks by metadata

3. **Integration Points**
   - Implement hooks in task creation/update to capture metadata
   - Add context tracking between related tasks
   - Create confidence level tracking for decisions

### Success Criteria

- AI assistants can store and retrieve their reasoning process
- Context is preserved between different AI sessions
- Metadata can be queried and analyzed

## Phase 2: Handoff System

### Objective

Create a structured handoff system to facilitate smooth transitions between AI sessions.

### Tasks

1. **Handoff Model**

   - Design handoff document schema
   - Implement versioning and sequencing
   - Create state tracking mechanisms

2. **CLI Commands**

   - Add `pm handoff create` command for creating handoff documents
   - Add `pm handoff list` command for viewing handoff history
   - Add `pm handoff show` command for detailed handoff information

3. **Integration Features**
   - Implement automatic state capture
   - Add progress tracking between handoffs
   - Create summary generation for handoffs

### Success Criteria

- Clear documentation of work completed between sessions
- Seamless continuation of work across different sessions
- Reduced context loss between AI transitions

## Phase 3: Storage Abstraction

### Objective

Create a flexible storage system that can adapt to different backend requirements.

### Tasks

1. **Interface Design**

   - Create abstract storage interface
   - Define standard operations contract
   - Implement SQLite as reference implementation

2. **Additional Backends**

   - Add support for PostgreSQL for larger deployments
   - Implement in-memory storage for testing
   - Create file-based JSON storage for simple deployments

3. **Migration Tools**
   - Create data migration utilities
   - Implement backup and restore functionality
   - Add configuration system for storage selection

### Success Criteria

- Storage backend can be swapped without code changes
- Data integrity is maintained across backend changes
- Performance is optimized for different use cases

## Phase 4: Graph Capabilities

### Objective

Enhance dependency management with advanced graph-based features.

### Tasks

1. **Graph Model**

   - Implement proper graph data structures
   - Create traversal algorithms for dependency chains
   - Add cycle detection and resolution

2. **CLI Commands**

   - Add `pm graph visualize` command for dependency visualization
   - Add `pm graph analyze` command for identifying bottlenecks
   - Add `pm graph path` command for finding dependency paths

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement critical path analysis
   - Add dependency impact assessment
   - Create automatic task ordering suggestions

### Success Criteria

- Complex dependency relationships can be visualized
- Critical path and bottlenecks are easily identified
- Task scheduling is optimized based on dependencies

## Phase 5: Integration with Other Tools

### Objective

Create integration points with other tools and platforms to enhance functionality.

### Tasks

1. **API Development**

   - Create RESTful API for external access
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add rate limiting and security features

2. **Notification System**

   - Add webhook support for events
   - Implement email notifications
   - Create customizable notification rules

3. **Platform Integrations**
   - Develop plugins for popular AI platforms
   - Create GitHub integration for code-related tasks
   - Add calendar integration for scheduling

### Success Criteria

- Tool can be integrated with existing workflows
- Notifications keep stakeholders informed
- External systems can interact with the project management data

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase                        | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Phase 1: AI Metadata         | 2 weeks            | None         |
| Phase 2: Handoff System      | 2 weeks            | Phase 1      |
| Phase 3: Storage Abstraction | 3 weeks            | None         |
| Phase 4: Graph Capabilities  | 3 weeks            | Phase 3      |
| Phase 5: Integration         | 4 weeks            | Phase 3      |

## Prioritization

1. **Phase 1: AI Metadata Integration** - Highest priority as it directly enhances the core AI-specific functionality
2. **Phase 2: Handoff System** - High priority for improving collaboration between AI sessions
3. **Phase 3: Storage Abstraction** - Medium priority as foundation for advanced features
4. **Phase 4: Graph Capabilities** - Medium priority for enhancing dependency management
5. **Phase 5: Integration** - Lower priority but valuable for ecosystem integration
